This package creates Latex code representing a gretl matrix as a Latex table.
Per default, the returned tex-file is only a snippet which can be included into
an existing Latex document. Optionally, the tex file can be stored as a
separate Tex document which can be compiled.

In order to work, you need to load the "threeparttable" package when compiling
your Latex document by means of:
"\usepackage{threeparttable}"

Please report bugs or comments on the gretl mailing list, write to
atecon@posteo.de or report an issue on github
(https://github.com/atecon/latextab).

You may also want to check out the mat2latex() function from the "extra" addon
which produces a string containing the representation of a matrix as a Latex
tabular environment.
